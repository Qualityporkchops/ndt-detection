# ndt-detection
3rd year research project: "Machine learning in engineering: defect detection in ultrasonic data using neural networks

develop ML models to classify ultrasonic data into defect and defect free signals

Simulated ultrsonic data in Python from an initial 5MHz toneburst
Developed 4 models: Multilayer perceptron, Convolutional neural network, Deep autoencoder, Convolutional autoencoder
